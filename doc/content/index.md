Structural Material Degradation Simulation Code
{: class="center-align" style="font-size:200%;font-weight:400"}


BlackBear is an application for modeling degradation phenomena in materials such as concrete and steel used in civil structures, as well as the response of those structures to the loading conditions that they are expected to safely withstand.  It is based on the finite element method and models interactions between the coupled physical systems involved.  BlackBear is based on the MOOSE framework, and builds on the MOOSE framework and modules for many of its core capabilities.

        BlackBear is based on the
        <a href="http://mooseframework.org/">
          MOOSE framework
        </a>
        . It is an extremely flexible environment
        that permits the solution of coupled physics problems of varying size and
        dimensionality. These can be solved using computer hardware appropriate for the model
        size, ranging from laptops and workstations to large high performance computers.

        Code reliability is a central principle in code development, and this
        project employs a well defined development and testing strategy.
        Code changes are only merged into the repository after both a manual
        code review and the automated regression test system have been completed.
        The testing process and status of BlackBear is available at
